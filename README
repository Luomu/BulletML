* What is BulletML?

Bullet Markup Language is an XML-based system for describing bullet 
barrages in shoot 'em up games. It is designed by the prolific 
shooting game author Kenta Cho.

The BulletML page can be found at 
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/index_e.html.

Here's an example:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE bulletml SYSTEM "http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/bulletml.dtd">
<bulletml xmlns="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml">
    <action label="top">
        <fire>
            <bullet>
                <direction type="absolute">90</direction>
            </bullet>
        </fire>
    </action>
</bulletml>

This script fires one bullet at angle 90, default speed. Not terribly 
useful yet. Here's a more complex example:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE bulletml SYSTEM "http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/bulletml.dtd">
<bulletml xmlns="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml">
    <action label="top">
        <fire>
            <direction type="aim">0</direction>
            <speed>150</speed>
            <bulletRef label="seed" />
        </fire>
    </action>

    <bullet label="seed">
        <action>
            <repeat>
                <times>100</times>
                <action>
                    <fire>
                        <direction type="absolute">$rand * 360</direction>
                        <speed>200 + $rank * 200</speed>
                        <bullet />
                    </fire>
                </action>
                <wait>50</wait>
            </repeat>
        </action>
    </bullet>
</bulletml>

This script fires a slow-moving bullet that in turn spawns 100 other 
bullets at 50ms intervals, in random directions. The speed of these 
bullets depends on the difficulty level (rank).

Check the demo game for a variety of patterns.

* About this plugin

This plugins adds a BulletML object that can read and play BulletML 
files. It is a bit like the existing particle system object; you can 
have multiple emitters and each object manages its own bullets.

While any bullet pattern could be created with events, describing them 
with external files is more reusable and they can be modified without 
changing the .cap.

* Appearance

You can either let the emitter render the bullets (just like a particle
system) by setting a texture or you can replace the bullets with
Sprite objects.

* Collisions

If you are not using Sprites as bullets this object has its own collision
condition. All collisions are bullet point against object bounding box.
Arcade shoot 'em up games usually use hidden hitboxes that are smaller
than the player craft.

Bullets are destroyed when they collide with an object.

* Directions, targeting

(absolute directions) When script type is "vertical" 0 is right and 90 
down. With "horizontal" 0 is up and 90 right.

If you want the bullets to fly in the direction the emitter is 
pointing, use "relative" direction and angle 0.

When no direction is specified, BulletML spec assumes "aim" is assumed;
bullet flies to the x,y coordinate set by "Set target position" action.

* Lifetime

Bullets are destroyed when they collide, exit the screen (toggleable),
their associated Sprite is destroyed or a set number of milliseconds is
exceeded.

If you Destroy the emitter, all its associated bullets vanish. This is a
technical limitation, but not too tricky to work around.

* Units

Speeds are pixels per second, time units are milliseconds. The BML spec 
treats time values as frames for some reason but this wouldn't be very 
useful when frame rate can be anything from tens to hundreds.

Separate multiplier values are provided for speeds and time values.

* Learning BulletML

Reading just the reference is not very good for learning the capabilities
of this system. Check out the demo game, this Java-based demo applet
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/bulletml_applet_e.html or
download some of Kenta Cho's games - many of them contain BulletML files
you can take apart.
